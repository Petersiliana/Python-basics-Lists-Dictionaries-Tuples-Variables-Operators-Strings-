# 1. Write a script that adds 15 and 30 and divides the sum by 2. Print out the answer.

print((15+30)/2)

# 2. Initialize two variables and use arithmetic operators to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder.

num_1 = 5
num_2 = 6_2 
sum = num_1 + num_2 
sub = num_1 - num_2 
multiply = num_1 * num_2 
divide = num_1 / num_2
print(sum, sub, multiply, divide)

# 3. Create a variable called name and store your name in it as a string.

name = "Noemi"

# 4. Create three variables in one line and assign each one a different food item.

a, b, c = "donut", "croissant", "coffee"
print(a, b, c)

# 5. Print out "Hello" ten times using arithmetic operators.

print("Hello world " * 10)

# 6. Set your name and age variables in one line with multiple assignment

name, age = "Noemi", 27

# 7. Create two strings and then create a third variable combining both of the two original strings.

str1 = "Garfield"
str2 = "the cat"

var = str1 + " " + str2
print(var)


# 8. Create a string and print the fourth letter of the word.

word = "Impossible"
print(word[3])

# 9. Print the letters from index 0 to 5.

print(word[0:5])

# 10. Create a variable and print all the letters from the first index until the end.

sen = "I love dogs."
print(sen[1:])
